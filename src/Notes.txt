Some problems that I am having:
- How do I parse the commands into their own lists, each time that I encounter a pipe, then I just add to the First element
- of the nested List, so then this would be like keeping each element relatively good
- for example, create a nested list, list within a list
- for each element of the list (which is  a list itself), then I am going to append to that element in the outer list
- When I encounter the pipe symbol, then I am going to stop appending to the first element, and I will increment the element index
- of my outer list, and then I will append to that the commands of what comes after the pipe

- This function can be called 'Parser'

Potential Edge Cases:
- Empty input
- Single Command
- Multiple spaces (More than one space)
- Leading Trail Spaces
- More than one pipe in a row
- What if there is a pipe at the start and then at the end
- Invalid commands that just would not work in general, not a part of /bin
- Cmmands with no args
- any type of characters that don't belong
-
